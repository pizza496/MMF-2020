                For my Math Maker Fair project I decided to explore the math behind epicycle drawings and learn how to create them. Epicycle drawings are those animations that are sometimes seen online, made from lots of rotating circles that draw an image. While researching for this project, I found a pretty good example of one below that draws Pi, created by 3Blue1Brown.

                What I found is that these animations are a special application of a Fourier Series where a set of rotating vectors are added together and the location of the tip is tracked through time. On the explanations page I give explanations for how the vectors are defined, the Fourier Series and transform I used to finalize the vectors for each example, and the code I use to actually generate the examples.
