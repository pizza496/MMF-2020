            <h1>The Math Behind The Animations</h1>
            <h3>What are these animations really?</h3>
            <p>
                Each of these animations is a set of rotating vectors which, as time progresses, will draw an image.
            </p>
            <h3>How do these vectors work?</h3>
            <p>
                Mathematically, each of these vectors is written in the form \( ce^{ti} \) where \( c \) is a complex number, and \(t\) is a variable for time. With this form, as time goes from \(0\) to \( 2\pi \) the vector will trace one complete circle.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why is this a vector?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Within the strictest technicalities, this isn't a vector, it is a complex number, but complex numbers can be represented as vectors when plotted on the complex plane. Since complex numbers are in the form \(Re + Im \cdot i \) they can be plotted on a graph with real and imaginary axis.
